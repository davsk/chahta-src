The Five Tribes of Oklahoma for Sovereignty and Self-Determination is a group of Indigenous citizens and allies who have come together in the wake of the Supreme Court decision McGirt. The Courtâ€™s finding that acknowledges the Mvskoke Creek Reservation in Oklahoma and implies recognition of Choctaw, Seminole, Chickasaw, and Cherokee reservations has inspired indigenous peoples around the world. We want to facilitate the energetic discussion among our followers/members/whatever, provide space for sharing information, and express our questions and aspirations to tribal leaders.
